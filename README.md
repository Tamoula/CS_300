# CS_300 Project

This project focuses on handling course information efficiently, including storing details, quickly finding specific information, and verifying prerequisites. The goal was to develop a system that is fast, organized, and memory-efficient.

## Project Objectives
1. Efficiently store and manage course details.
2. Enable quick search and retrieval of specific information.
3. Ensure the correct handling and verification of prerequisites.

## Problem-Solving Approach
The problem was approached in three parts:
1. **Storage:** Using appropriate data structures for efficient data handling.
2. **Searching:** Employing hash tables for fast lookups and binary search trees for sorted data access.
3. **Validation:** Implementing methods to check and validate course prerequisites effectively.

### Why Data Structures Matter
Understanding and selecting the right data structures (like vectors, hash tables, and binary search trees) is crucial for creating a system that performs well and is easy to maintain.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Breaking Down Problems:** Divided complex tasks into smaller, manageable parts to simplify debugging.
- **Testing and Iteration:** Experimented with alternative methods and data structures, revisiting fundamentals when necessary.
- **External Resources:** Leveraged online platforms like YouTube and Google for additional guidance.

## Learning Outcomes
This project has expanded my skills in:
- Software design: Breaking down problems and choosing efficient solutions.
- Writing adaptable programs: Creating maintainable, readable, and flexible code.
- Problem-solving: Overcoming roadblocks with resourcefulness and persistence.

## Future Improvements
The current program design sets the groundwork for further enhancements, including optimizing data handling and expanding functionality as needed.
